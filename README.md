# STUDENT STRESS MONITORING PROJECT

*Analysis on a Stress Level Dataset to Predict Student Stress*

---

##  Overview

This project explores and models the stress levels of students using a dataset and machine learning techniques. It aims to identify patterns and predictors of stress to pave the way for proactive interventions and better student well-being.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset StressLevelDataset.csv contains various features relevant to student life and stress levels, such as:

- *Academic metrics*: study time, grades, etc.
- *Personal factors*: hobbies, daily routines, lifestyle indicators
- *Stress labels*: categories or scores indicating stress level

(For full feature descriptions, refer to columns in the CSV or extended documentation.)

##  Analysis Pipeline (Analysis.ipynb)

This notebook walks through the full analytic workflow:

1. *Importing libraries and data*
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations among features
   - Identifying trends linked to stress levels
3. *Data preprocessing*
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data
4. *Model development*
   - Classification models for stress level prediction (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest)
   - Regression or multi-output approaches if stress is continuous
5. *Evaluation*
   - Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, RMSE)
   - Cross-validation and generalizability checks
6. *Feature importance and interpretability*
   - Highlighting which variables most influence stress outcomes
7. *Conclusion*
   - Key findings and insights
